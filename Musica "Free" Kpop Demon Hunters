    <h1>Free</h1>

    <p>
        I tried to hide but something broke<br />
        I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes<br />
        The words kept catching in my throat<br />
        I tried to smile, I was suffocating though<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        But here with you, I can finally breathe<br />
        You say you're no good, but you're good for me<br />
        I've been hoping to change, now I know we can change<br />
        But I won't if you're not by my side<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        We could be free, free<br />
        We can't fix it if we never face it<br />
        Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Why does it feel right every time I let you in?<br />
        Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?<br />
        All the secrets that keep me in chains<br />
        And all the damage that might make me dangerous<br />
        You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one<br />
        What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        We can't fix it if we never face it<br />
        What if we find a way to escape it?<br />
        We could be free, free<br />
        Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Time goes by and I lose perspective<br />
        Hope only hurts, so I just forget it<br />
        But you're breaking through all the dark in me<br />
        When I thought that nobody could<br />
        And you're waking up all these parts of me<br />
        That I thought were buried for good<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Between imposter and this monster<br />
        I've been lost inside my head<br />
        Ain't no choice when all these voices<br />
        Keep me pointing towards no end<br />
        It's just easy when I'm with you<br />
        No one sees me the way you do<br />
        I don't trust it, but I want to<br />
        I keep coming back to<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        Why does it feel right every time I let you in?<br />
        Why does it feel like I can tell you anything?<br />
        We can't fix it if we never face it<br />
        What if we find a way to escape it?<br />
        We could be free, free<br />
        Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        So take my hand, it's open (free, free)<br />
        What if we heal what's broken? (free, free)<br />
        I tried to hide but something broke<br />
        I couldn't sing, but you give me hope<br />
        We can't fix it if we never face it<br />
        Let the past be the past 'til it's weightless<br />
    </p>
